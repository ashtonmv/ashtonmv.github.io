    - "Hi, I'm Michael! I built the Particular theme based on the
    <a href='https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/freelancer-theme'>freelancer</a> theme and
    <a href='https://jnicol.github.io/particleground/' target='_blank'>particleground.js</a> from
    <a href='https://github.com/jnicol' target='_blank'>jnicol</a>."
    - "I use this theme for <a href='https://www.michael-ashton.com' target='_blank'>my own personal
    site</a>, where you can learn a little more about me (and even read some comics!)."

    - "I hope you enjoy using this theme as much as I've enjoyed building it <i class='fa fa-smile-beam'></i> The icons
    for all 6 projects included as examples were built on <a href='https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik' target='_blank'>Freepik</a>
    from <a href='https://www.flaticon.com/' target='_blank'>www.flaticon.com</a> (a site I highly recommend)."

    - "For details about how to install and configure the theme, please checkout the README file in
    <a href='https://github.com/ashtonmv/particular-theme' target='_blank'>the Github repository</a>.
    If you have any questions that aren't answered there (or for bug reports),
    please open an issue and I'll look into it."
