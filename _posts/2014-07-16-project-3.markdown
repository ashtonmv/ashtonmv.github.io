description: Pyrho is a real-space DFT code written in Python. It is not built to be super-fast or scalable- instead, it is built to be super-readable.

In the last few decades, thousands of Ph.D.'s have been given to hard-working theoreticians who solved complex scientific problems using density functional theory (DFT) codes that they don't really understand. Pyrho exists to make the "under-the hood" foundation for most DFT codes accessible to those of us who aren't brave enough to dive into the source code of research grade DFT software packages.
