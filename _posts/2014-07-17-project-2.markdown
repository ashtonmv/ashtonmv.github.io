description: The Materials Project crystal structure database has been searched for materials possessing layered motifs in their crystal structures using a topology-scaling algorithm. The algorithm identifies and measures the sizes of bonded atomic clusters in a structure's unit cell, and determines their scaling with cell size. The search yielded 826 stable layered materials, which are considered as candidates for the formation of two-dimensional monolayers via exfoliation. Density-functional theory calculates the exfoliation energy of each material and 681 monolayers are found to exhibit exfoliation energies below those of certain already-extant two-dimensional materials, indicating the possibility of exfoliating them from bulk phases. The crystal structures of these two-dimensional materials provide templates for future theoretical searches of stable two-dimensional materials. The optimized structures and other data for all 826 monolayers are provided at https://materialsweb.org.
