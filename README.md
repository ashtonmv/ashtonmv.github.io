# Getting started
Welcome to the Hennig materials theory group! This repository exists to help
new users to understand the computational methods being used in the group and
to get started researching their own materials.

# How to use this repository
Below you have access to several tutorial "objectives" that cover a number of topics relevant
to performing research efficiently during your time in the group (and hopefully beyond!)

Each objective is intended to be roughly one day's work,
but feel free to go through them at your own pace. The objectives are intended
to take you from "zero to sixty" on a variety of different topics, and include everything
from opening accounts on supercomputers to learning Linux & Python to running
research grade density-functional theory calculations.

You are probably already in touch with another member of the group who is acting
as a kind of mentor right now- the idea is that you email them with any questions you have
as you go through the objectives.

If you run into software issues with any of the examples, please just post
an issue to the [issues page of this repository](https://github.com/ashtonmv/ashtonmv.github.io/issues).
