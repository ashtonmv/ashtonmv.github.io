        name: Light Roast Comics
        link: http://lightroastcomics.com
        description: I started drawing Light Roast Comics in 2018, and quickly fell in love. I've always loved the idea of drawing, but until I started making comics I never had a reason to practice every day. That, plus my recent discovery of digital drawing (I will not switch back until they invent control-z for real life) have made this one of the most fun projects I've worked on in the last few years.
