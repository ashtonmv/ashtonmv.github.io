## Hey! My name is Michael.

I'm a frontend developer based in Cologne, Germany. But I am not from Germany.

When I'm not developing, I play a lot of basketball and also [draw comics from time to time](http://lightroastcomics.com).

### A little disclaimer

I used to be a scientist, but then I stopped. If you came here looking for any kind of scientific content, I left you a link to my old Google Scholar page in the menu above. There are also quite a few science-y repositories on my Github page. I can assure you that nothing you find on this site will be scientific in any way.
