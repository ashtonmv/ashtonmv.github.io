## Hey! My name is Michael.

I'm a frontend developer based in Cologne, Germany. But I am not from Germany.

When I'm not developing, I play a lot of basketball and also [draw comics from time to time](https://lightroastcomics.com).

### A little disclaimer

I used to be a scientist, but then I stopped. If you came here looking for any kind of scientific content, I left you a link to my old Google Scholar page in the menu above. There are also quite a few science-y repositories on my Github page. I can assure you that nothing you find on this site will be scientific in any way.

### Oh by the way,
I'm all about open-source and recycled code. Right now you're looking at my website built as a Vue app, and if you'd like instructions on how to re-create this site for yourself you can find them on the [Github repository](https://github.com/ashtonmv/vue-portfolio).
